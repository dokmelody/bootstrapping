This small piece of Dok code is compiling and running:

```text
data Int [

]

data A [
  :^ This is the definition of `A` data type

  fun f::Int {
    return 0
  }

  variant ../B [
    :^ `A/B` is a subtype (i.e. variant) of type `A`

    fun f::Int -override {

      : This is a normal comment, inside the code of `A/B.f`

      return 1
    }
  ]

  variant ../C [
    fun f::Int -override {
      return 2
    }
  ]
]

var a::A
assert a.f == 0

var b::A/B
assert b.f == 1

var c::A/C
assert c.f == 2
```

The syntax of Dok is rather regular, in the hope it can be also extensible with DSL. So conventions are:
- the first element is always the statement or the data declaration
- `[ ... ]` is used for declaring data/values
- `{ ... }` is used for declaring instructions to run
- type names are hierarchical, e.g. the type `B` has full qualified name `A/B`, and it is a subtype of `A`
